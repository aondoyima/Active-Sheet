# Active-Sheet
Calculation of flow field and stresses in a model for epithelial tissue with active mechano-chemical feedback. 

The model is described in my paper here: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.238301 

## How to use
- Input parameters and run "main.py" using "run_batch.sh". 
- "main.py" carries out the numerical solution for the coupled differential equations in the model for the actomyosin tensor, passive pressure, and velocity field.

## Dependencies and Packages
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for turning a series of plots into a movie
